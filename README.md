### Treehouse Techdegree capstone project summary and guidelines:

>In this final, "Capstone" project, you'll bring together everything you've learned to create your own web application. You'll need to build all aspects of the site including an interactive front end. On the backend you'll manage data with a database and talk to at least two other web sites by connecting to their APIs. Finally, you'll host this site on the web so the world can see  your finished, running web application.

>You can build this project using any of the technologies you've learned so far such as React, and the MEAN stack, a relational database like MySQL, a document-based database like MongoDB, Bootstrap, jQuery, Express, and Node. Please don't use backend frameworks that we haven't taught in the Techdegree, such as Koa, Sails, or Meteor. You can use any front end libraries and frameworks.
